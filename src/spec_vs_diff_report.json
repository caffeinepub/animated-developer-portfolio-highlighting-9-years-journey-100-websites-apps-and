  "summary": "Diff adds a multi-section single-page portfolio (Hero, Journey timeline w/ scroll reveal + progress indicator, Work tabbed categories, Services cards w/ CTA, Contact form w/ validation + placeholders) and a warm/copper theme with reduced-motion handling. However, the requested generated icon assets are not evidenced as present/used, and several extra/auth-related infrastructure pieces were added that were not requested.",

      "requirement": "Add static generated image assets (hero background + category/service icons) under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them directly; use hero image prominently and use generated icons consistently for categories/services.",
      "reason": "The hero and timeline accent images are referenced, but the diff does not show the required generated icon sets being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, nor does it show those generated icons being used for Work category visuals or Service cards. Work and Services currently use lucide-react icons, not the specified generated icon PNG sets. Also, the diff summary omits some added files, so asset presence cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
